		// We call this an 'exhaustive search'
		// To compare this algorithm to others, we'll use 'Big O' notation
		// We can't compare algorithm runtime in terms of seconds...
		// ...This would cause discrepancies between different machines!
		// Instead, we measure 'time' in terms of the length of data
		// We use the symbol 'N' to represent the length of a theoretical dataset
		// In Big-O terms, we say the 'worst-case' runtime complexity as a function of N
		// This algorithm- an exhaustive search- is O(N), also called 'linear' complexity
		// As the length of the array (N) grows, so does the amount of runtime

		// Iterate over every possible index in the array...
		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
			// If the element at the i-th index is equal to the value we are looking for...
			if (arr[i] == value) {
				// ...Then return the index.
				return i;
			}

			// Should we return -1 here?
			// No- just because the value was not found at the i-th index, doesn't mean it won't be found at the (i+1)-th index.
			// We have to continue searching the array.
		}

		// If we reach this point, the value was not found in the array.
		// The method MUST return something, so we return -1.
		// This is a good value to return, because it is not a valid index.
		return -1;

	// Another useful function is 'contains'
	// It returns 'true' if the given array contains the given value, false otherwise
	private static boolean contains(double[] arr, double value) {
		// Both 'indexOf' and 'contains' are functionally identical
		// Since 'indexOf' returns more useful information, we can consolidate 'contains'
		// If 'indexOf' returns -1, then this tells us that the element was not found

		// This is the same as saying if(x<x) which is mathematically impossible
		// So, we start i=1 to avoid this redundancy
		// But wait! What if the array is only length 1, there is no 1-th element!

			// This can be confusing, but it's a common convention
			//
			// We start 'j' at 'i+1' because we don't want to compare the i-th element to itself
			// We wouldn't start it at 0 because we know that everything to the left of the cursor 'i' is sorted
